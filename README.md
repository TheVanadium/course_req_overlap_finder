# Unofficial UC Merced Badge Finder

A website where users can select UC Merced badges and get a list of courses that fulfill them.

## Installation
Clone this repository and install node modules using `npm install`.

## Usage
This website only works with the UC Merced Badge API (https://github.com/TheVanadium/uc_merced_badge_api), which is not publicly hosted yet. To run this file, you must clone both this repository and the UC Merced Badge API repository and run both at the same time.

On the left-hand side there is a checklist of badges you can select or deselect. On the right-hand side is the list of courses that have all of the badges. Please always double-check GE fulfillments with the UC Merced catalog before registering for courses.
